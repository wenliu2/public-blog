Your Kubernetes master has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  /docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join <master-ip>:<master-port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
```

If you are the root, run below:
`export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf`


#### Install calico network add-on
```
kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.3/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/rbac-kdd.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.3/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/kubernetes-datastore/calico-networking/1.7/calico.yaml
```

#### Check all run well
```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system

kube-proxy-wbxjq                           1/1     Running   1          36m
kube-scheduler-r1-k8s01-2664920            1/1     Running   1          35m
```

If the coredns pods showing error, fix it with below steps:   
1. open and config the configmap of coredns `kubectl edit cm coredns -n kube-system`   
2. delete 'loop', save and exit   
3. restart coredns pods by:
`
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -oname |grep coredns |xargs kubectl delete -n kube-system
`   
4. wait the coredns restart and check the output. It may take 2~3 minutes.


## Joining your nodes
---
The nodes are where your workloads (containers and pods, etc) run. To add new nodes to your cluster do the following for each machine:

* SSH to the machine
* Become root (e.g. sudo su -)
* Run the command that was output by kubeadm init. For example:
```kubeadm join --token <token> <master-ip>:<master-port> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>```   

If you do not have the token, you can get it by running the following command on the master node:

`kubeadm token list`
The output is similar to this:
```
TOKEN                    TTL  EXPIRES              USAGES           DESCRIPTION            EXTRA GROUPS
8ewj1p.9r9hcjoqgajrj4gi  23h  2018-06-12T02:51:28Z authentication,  The default bootstrap  system:
                                                   signing          token generated by     bootstrappers:
                                                                    'kubeadm init'.        kubeadm:
                                                                                           default-node-token
```                                                                                           
By default, tokens expire after 24 hours. If you are joining a node to the cluster after the current token has expired, you can create a new token by running the following command on the master node:

`kubeadm token create`
The output is similar to this:
```
5didvk.d09sbcov8ph2amjw
```
If you donâ€™t have the value of --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash, you can get it by running the following command chain on the master node:
```
openssl x509 -pubkey -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt | openssl rsa -pubin -outform der 2>/dev/null | \
   openssl dgst -sha256 -hex | sed 's/^.* //'
```
The output is similar to this:
```
8cb2de97839780a412b93877f8507ad6c94f73add17d5d7058e91741c9d5ec78
```
Note: To specify an IPv6 tuple for <master-ip>:<master-port>, IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets, for example: [fd00::101]:2073.
The output should look something like:
```
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks

... (log output of join workflow) ...
```

Node join complete:   

* Certificate signing request sent to master and response received.
* Kubelet informed of new secure connection details.

Run `kubectl get nodes` on the master to see this machine join.
A few seconds later, you should notice this node in the output from kubectl get nodes when run on the master.
